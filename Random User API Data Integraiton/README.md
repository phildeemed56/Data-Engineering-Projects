**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to integrate C# and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to process JSON data obtained from the RandomUser API. The goal is to showcase how the same JSON data processing logic can be executed both in a standalone C# environment and within an SSIS Script Task. The project also includes the necessary SQL scripts for database and table creation, ensuring seamless data storage.
